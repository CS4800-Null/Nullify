Web application project for CS4800.

Project Overview
--------
This project is a web app that collects quick links for account settings, password change, and account deletion pages for many popular websites. It is designed to help users quickly change their account settings or delete their accounts on websites, without having to search for the correct page to do so. 

The web app also includes a login feature, which allows users to create their own folders to organize websites they have an account with.
